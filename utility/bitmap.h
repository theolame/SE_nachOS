    \brief Data structures defining a bitmap 
  
        An array of bits each of which
  	can be either on or off.
  
  	Represented as an array of unsigned integers, on which we do
  	modulo arithmetic to find the bit we are interested in.
  
  	The bitmap can be parameterized with with the number of bits being 
  	managed.

/*!  \brief Defines a "bitmap" -- an array of bits
  
   Each of which can be independently set, cleared, and tested.
  
   Most useful for managing the allocation of the elements of an array --
   for instance, disk sectors, or main memory pages.
   Each bit represents whether the corresponding sector or page is
   in use or free.
