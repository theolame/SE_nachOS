/*! \brief Defines a "synchronous" disk abstraction.
//
// As with other I/O devices, the raw physical disk is an asynchronous
// device -- requests to read or write portions of the disk (sectors)
// return immediately, and an interrupt occurs later to signal that the
// operation completed.  (Also, the physical characteristics of the
// disk device assume that only one operation can be requested at a
// time).
//
// This class provides the abstraction that for any individual thread
// making a request, it waits around until the operation finishes before
// returning.
