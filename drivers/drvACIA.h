  \brief Data structures for the ACIA device driver
   interrupt_send and interrupt_receive are used in the intrrupt mode only.
  
        The ACIA is an asynchronous device (requests return 
        immediately, and an interrupt happens later on).  
        This is a layer on top of the ACIA.
        Two working modes are to be implemented in assignment 2:
        a Busy Waiting mode and an Interrupt mode. The Busy Waiting
        mode implements a synchronous IO whereas IOs are asynchronous
        IOs are implemented in the Interrupt mode (see the Nachos
        roadmap for further details).
