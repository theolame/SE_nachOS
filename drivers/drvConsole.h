/*! \brief Defines a "synchronous" console abstraction.
//
// As with other I/O devices, the console is an asynchronous device.
// This class provides methods in order to preserve mutual exclusion
// on the console device. Two operations can be called : the first one
// writes a string to the console and the second one reads a string from
// the console. They return only when the read or write operation is 
// completed.
