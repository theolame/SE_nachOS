    \brief Data structures to emulate a hardware timer.
  
	A hardware timer generates a CPU interrupt every X milliseconds.
  	This means it can be used for implementing time-slicing, or for
  	having a thread go to sleep for a specific period of time. 
  
  	We emulate a hardware timer by scheduling an interrupt to occur
  	every time stats->totalTicks has increased by TimerTicks.
  
  	In order to introduce some randomness into time-slicing, if "doRandom"
  	is set, then the interrupt comes after a random number of ticks.

  DO NOT CHANGE -- part of the machine emulation
